## Structure
### Simple Apps - Raspberri Pi
In this project, I have made a folder named 'Simple Apps - Raspberri Pi' that concludes the neccessary simple python codes to complete this project. I think it is also a good tutorial for new raspberry pi users.
### Simple Apps - Arduino

## Completing Notes
* We used Fingerprint Sensor instead of mobile app.
* We wanted to use Light Sensor instead of CO Detection Sensor, but unfortunately it damaged.
* We want to use Bluetooth Sensor for additional score, to show a UI/UX for our elevator.
* We have made a Web Application for the previous task.
